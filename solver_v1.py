# Version 1.0, Random
# This program chooses a random word from a list of possible solutions, if the word is not correct it takes all the clues given,
# reduces the list of possible words and retries (randomly)
#
# Time to run 100 tries: about 15 seconds
# Results: 90% Win-rate after six tries
# In average it takes 4.85 tries to find the solution
# Approx. plot
