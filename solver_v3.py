# Version 3.0, Frequency
# While trying to find the best word to minimize the choices is a good strategy, there comes a point where the best play is to choose
# the most probable between the remaining, to finally finish the game; this version of the solver in fact after a certain threshold
# stops choosing the 'most efficient' word and tries to find the 'most probable' one.
#
# Time to run 100 tries: about 1 minute and 30 seconds
# Results: 99% Win-rate after six tries
# In average it takes 3.9 tries to find the solution
