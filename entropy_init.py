# Program that finds the word with the highest entropy in the list and writes it in a file
# Since initially there are 12972 words and 243 possible combinations for every word
# it takes a lot of time to find the entropy of every word (1.5 seconds per word)
# 1.5 * 12972 / 3600 = 5.5 hours to complete
# 12972^2 * 3^5 = 4*10^10 checks done
